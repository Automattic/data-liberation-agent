## 2026-03-31 — Initial extraction strategy

**Found by:** Human contributor (initial research)
**During:** Building this repo
**Type:** API endpoint | window global | architecture

### What I found
Wix sites make structured JSON API calls to their own backend during page load. Intercepting these calls gives cleaner data than parsing the rendered HTML output. Key endpoints include `/_api/wix-blog-frontend-server/`, `/_api/wix-public-data-webapp/`, and `www.wixapis.com`.

### How it works
Using Playwright's `page.on('response', ...)` handler to capture all `application/json` responses from `/_api/*` and `wixapis.com` URLs during normal page load. The responses contain structured blog post bodies, page metadata, CMS collection data.

### Why it's better than the previous approach
HTML scraping requires parsing Wix's heavily nested, obfuscated markup. API interception gives you clean JSON with semantic field names, correct dates, author information, and structured content — everything you'd want for a clean migration.
