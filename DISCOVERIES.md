## 2026-03-31 — Wix Dashboard API reverse engineering via CDP

**Found by:** Claude + human contributor (live probing against Brave browser)
**During:** Building the probe tool against a real Wix account
**Type:** API endpoint | window global | architecture

### What I found

Connected to a live Brave browser session via CDP (port 9222) and probed both the Wix Dashboard (`manage.wix.com`) and Editor (`editor.wix.com`) pages. Key findings:

**Auth pattern**: Wix uses cookie-based auth + `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header + per-app `authorization` tokens (signed JWTs unique to each Wix "app" like blog, chat, etc.). The XSRF token comes from the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie. The authorization tokens are embedded in the page at load time and are app-scoped.

**Key API endpoints discovered (all returning 200)**:
- `/_api/account-server/v1/users/my_accounts` — lists all user accounts
- `/_api/premium-store/plans/premiumStatus?metaSiteId=...` — shows plan type (FREE, PREMIUM, etc.)
- `/_api/site-actions/topology` — static asset URLs and service versions
- `/_api/header-server/init` — massive experiments config + feature flags
- `/_api/items-selection-service/v1/items-selection/installed-providers` — all installed Wix apps/providers (11KB+ of data)
- `/_api/notifications-widget-server/alerts` — site alerts
- `/_api/wix-laboratory-server/v1/laboratory/platform/conductAllInScope` — feature flag values per scope
- `/_api/dealer-offers-serving-service/v1/dealer/serving/offers/bulk` — 50KB of UI offers/placements

**Window globals of note**:
- `Wix` — object with `getSiteInfo`, `Dashboard`, `Utils`, `Settings`, `SuperApps`
- `__MEDIA_TOKEN__` — JWT for media CDN access (314 chars)
- `__WIXEXP_OWNER_ACCOUNT_ID_` / `__WIXEXP_LOGGED_IN_USER_ID_` — account UUIDs
- `__CAIRO_EXPERIMENTS__` — editor experiment flags
- `WIXCKEDITOR` — CKEditor instance (editor page only)

**What didn't work**: Calling `/_api/site-properties-service/properties` requires the metaSiteId as a specific header (not query param), and the blog API (`/_api/communities-blog-node-api/_api/posts/list`) requires a blog-specific `instanceId` different from the main site auth token.

### How it works

The `probe.js` script connects to a running browser via `playwright.chromium.connectOverCDP()`, then for each Wix page:
1. Scans `window` for all `__*` / `wix*` globals
2. Extracts JSON-LD structured data
3. Lists cookies and localStorage
4. Reads performance API entries for API endpoint discovery
5. Extracts site identity (metaSiteId, account IDs)

For deeper probing, we reload pages while the CDP Network domain captures full request/response pairs including auth headers and response bodies.

### Why it's better than the previous approach

Direct API probing against the user's own authenticated browser session means:
- No need to reverse-engineer auth — the browser already has valid cookies
- Response bodies captured via `Network.getResponseBody` give clean JSON
- The user-agent matches perfectly because it IS the user's browser
- Each Wix "app" (blog, store, forms) has its own auth token scoped to that app — intercepting during navigation is the reliable way to capture these per-app tokens

## 2026-03-31 — Initial extraction strategy

**Found by:** Human contributor (initial research)
**During:** Building this repo
**Type:** API endpoint | window global | architecture

### What I found
Wix sites make structured JSON API calls to their own backend during page load. Intercepting these calls gives cleaner data than parsing the rendered HTML output. Key endpoints include `/_api/wix-blog-frontend-server/`, `/_api/wix-public-data-webapp/`, and `www.wixapis.com`.

### How it works
Using Playwright's `page.on('response', ...)` handler to capture all `application/json` responses from `/_api/*` and `wixapis.com` URLs during normal page load. The responses contain structured blog post bodies, page metadata, CMS collection data.

### Why it's better than the previous approach
HTML scraping requires parsing Wix's heavily nested, obfuscated markup. API interception gives you clean JSON with semantic field names, correct dates, author information, and structured content — everything you'd want for a clean migration.
